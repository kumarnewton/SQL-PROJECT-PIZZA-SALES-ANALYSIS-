# SQL-PROJECT-PIZZA-SALES-ANALYSIS-

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data using MySQL, focusing on sales trends and customer preferences. By leveraging SQL's window and aggregate functions, I extracted key insights to inform business decisions.

Key Objectives:

Total Orders and Revenue: Calculated the overall number of orders and total revenue to assess business performance.

Top-Selling Pizzas: Identified the most popular pizza types and sizes to understand customer preferences.

Sales Trends: Analyzed ordering patterns across different times and dates to determine peak sales periods.

Methodology:

Data Aggregation: Utilized aggregate functions to summarize data, such as total sales and average order values.

Ranking Analysis: Employed window functions to rank pizzas based on sales and revenue, highlighting top performers.

Trend Analysis: Examined sales data over time to identify trends and seasonal patterns.

This analysis provides actionable insights into customer behavior and sales performance, enabling data-driven strategies for enhancing business operations.
